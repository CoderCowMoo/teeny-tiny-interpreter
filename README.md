# Teeny tiny compiler in Rust

This is a Teeny Tiny compiler in Rust loosely following the [python tutorial](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html). I say loosely because I mostly just tried to get what he had
as an end result and make do. The project is a main binary and a lexer, parser and emitter split up into libraries for easy use.
